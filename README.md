# Soldier Run
The repository soldier-run will be used to contain the newest game I am working on. You can read more about this game below this line of text. Also please check the file where I will be posting daily reports on the status of the game. There will also be a meter(or progress bar) showing the progress of the game(Note: The meter element is not supported in IE).
### Meter example

<meter max="10" high="8" low="2" value="6">6</meter>
